Have you ever observed a dark horse up close? It's a rare sight, but when the world witnesses one, they are rarely forgotten. They transcend competition. And no, I'm not referring to an equine beast of dark complexion. 
In the world of competition, a dark horse is a competitor that on paper is unlikely to succeed but somehow still does. A dark horse differs from an underdog in that an underdog is not expected to win and is by all means inferior to the “favourites.” A dark horse however defeats everyone else not through circumstance or sheer luck, but with a unique skillset or understanding that is not shared by their opponents. Their very existence transcends the tournament. True Dark Horses change how the game is played and understood. They are inspiring, since they are physical demonstrations of the fact that there is usually more than one way to succeed. It’s only a matter of finding a way to do it.
